            <h2 class="text-center">How he was acquired</h2>
            <p>The owner of the cat met up with two middle school friends and they offered the cat up for adoption and the owner took him, the original owner of the cat got him from Mars. It was easy at first tho because Peter Pan had to get the approval of his mother and his mother didn't want a new cat/kitten. He was hiding it from his mother for about a month before she found out. He told her that he was babysitting it for a friend and eventually his mom didnt care that he had one.</p>

         <h2 class="text-center">Heritage</h2>
            <p>Comes from a line of royalty. related to the cat of the somalian prince Ali Yousef, that is where he gets his habit of squezzing through beds. His heritages dates back all the way to Egypt when the Egyptians worship cats as gods. His ancestors were treated better than humans now, that is why he acts so spoiled when it comes to food and everything else. All of this is one hundred percent real.</p>
